title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):
- *First:* attr_accessor provides an efficient means of enabling reading and writing methods on instances variables within a class.
- *Second:* I can write blocks with {} and can pass these standalone blocks to a method. For example, 
- *Third:* Yield is a keyword like break or return.
